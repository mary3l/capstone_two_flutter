# Voice Recognition-Based Basketball Performance Analysis App

## Overview

This project introduces a voice recognition-based application designed to enhance basketball performance analysis by recording player statistics in noisy game environments. The application aims to minimize human errors and reduce the time required for manual data entry.

Leveraging **Google Teachable Machine** for audio classification, the app addresses the challenges posed by background noise in speech-to-text data processing. By developing a mobile application, the project seeks to provide coaches, players, and analysts with real-time, clear speech data for better sports analysis.

## Objectives

The primary objectives of the study are:

1. **Designing the App**: Develop an intuitive mobile application that allows users to record and access player statistics effortlessly.
2. **Evaluating Google Teachable Machine**: Assess the performance of Google Teachable Machine in audio classification, particularly in noisy environments.
3. **Assessing Impact**: Analyze how the application enhances player performance analysis by providing accurate and timely data.

## Significance

This project aims to revolutionize sports analysis methods by aiding coaches, players, and analysts in understanding team dynamics and individual performance. The integration of machine learning technology in sports analytics offers a promising avenue for improving performance assessment and enhancing player development.

## Scope

The application focuses on basketball-related sounds, with specific limitations in the areas of:

- **Noisy Speech Classification**: Addressing the challenges of recognizing speech amidst background noise.
- **Clean Speech Processing**: Ensuring accurate transcription of clear speech data for reliable analysis.
